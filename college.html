		<h6>So after a long exam time with loads of entrances and the biggy(boards), I was in no mood to study for a long time. But then I get to know that i have been given admission in this college called IIIT-D which is rigorous in it's acdemic approach (Indeed it is).</h6><h6> Though it has only been 4 months in this college, I am really impressed with the way this place functions. Evrything in the college is very well organised and I was amazed to to see how efficiently the institute uses latest technology. The use of Backpack and the iiitd email is simply amazing. I love the coding culture of the place and wish to develop my interest further in the domain. The faculty is highly qualified and it is no less than a priviledge to learn from them.  </h6>
		<h4>I hope the next 4 years in this place will be cherished by me forever! :)</h4>
