		<h6> A place I call home away from home! I have spent so much time in this place and have never thanked it enough. A lot of memories reside inside the boundaries of this place that I cherish and will continue to do so. I joined the school back in 2003 and did all my schooling from here. <br> What I like the most about my school is that it believes in plateaus more than peaks. There is no concept of 1st 2nd and 3rd. A student is awarded for the work he/she has done. Various other activities in the school like waving hands as a sign of greeting and its cultural programmes like the food festival and Musical Afternoon make it very different from the outside world. SPV has been excelling in the academic and cocurricular aspects for a long time now. It stands tall with its 60 years of experience and care for the society. Its like a world of its own and truly stands to the caption- "A School Of Thought!"</h6><h6>Another great aspect of my school life were my friends. In SPV, I made friends that will stay with me forever. From playing cricket, bunking classes to calling each other at 2 in the night to clarify doubts... we have done it all. We have plagiarized in practicals  and helped each others in tests and exams uncountable times. (P.S. IIITDians Kindly omit!) Coming now to the wonderful staff of the school. I can't thank the teachers enough for what they have moulded me into. I kind of miss those praises and scoldings from them! Even the help staff was so kind, they would go out of their way to help you!</h6>
<h4>I take this platform to thank SPV for all the love and care! Patelian Always! :)</h4>
